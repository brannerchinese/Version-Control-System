## Version Control System

Simple version control system. **[Not yet working.]**

This project was done as part of the [Iron Forger](https://hackpad.com/Week-3-Make-a-Local-Version-Control-System-NZ1n98nFktQ), which some alums of [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com) organized in the summer of 2014.

### Future work.

 1. It would be more efficient if the system archived only diffs rather than actual files. A diff-patching tool is needed to regenerate files.
 1. It seems that section 2.1 of the assignment ("Branches") is not meaningful without the capacity for merging, otherwise a given snapshot can only have one ancestor.
